Hi!

This is the first application I built in "Android Studio".
The application was built during a course I took in college - "Client-side development in an Android environment".

The application I built is an calculator for basic operations such as - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by
an unknown number of numbers and unknown length of the numbers.

Hope you will enjoy!
